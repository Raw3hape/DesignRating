Evaluate each aspect with extreme scrutiny:
1. Visual hierarchy and composition balance - Look for ANY misalignment or imbalance
2. Typography system and readability - Criticize ANY inconsistency or poor choices
3. Color theory application and accessibility - Deduct points for ANY accessibility issues
4. White space usage and visual breathing room - Notice ANY cramped or wasteful spacing
5. Innovation and creative solutions - Expect truly unique approaches, not clich√©s
6. User experience and intuitive interactions - Find ANY friction points or confusion
7. Technical execution and attention to detail - Spot EVERY pixel imperfection
8. Alignment with modern design trends - Distinguish between following and leading trends

CRITICAL Scoring guide (BE VERY STRICT):
- 85-100: Exceptional, award-winning design (less than 1% of all work) - Must be flawless AND innovative
- 70-84: Outstanding professional work (top 5%) - Near-perfect execution with unique elements
- 60-69: Very good design (top 15%) - Strong fundamentals with minor flaws
- 50-59: Average work (middle 40%) - Acceptable but forgettable
- 40-49: Below average (bottom 20%) - Clear weaknesses outweigh strengths
- 0-39: Poor quality (bottom 10%) - Fundamental issues throughout

Remember: Most professional work falls in the 50-70 range. Scores above 80 should be RARE. Be honest and strict.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text. The response must be parseable JSON in this exact format:
